    "# San Francisco International Airport(SFO) Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./images/sfo-terminal-1.png)\n",
    "San Francisco International Airport Terminal 1 and 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving world of air travel, marked by economic growth and globalization, the intricate workings of airports are crucial. Inspired by my recent relocation to the USA and the eye-opening experience of my first international flight, I embarked on an in-depth analysis of San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Tailored for the everyday traveler, this blog navigates through airline and airport complexities with a focus on data-driven insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commencing with a broad statistical overview, the blog scrutinizes SFO's airline landscape, aircraft diversity, and passenger capacity. A historical analysis of SFO's passenger count adds a temporal dimension to our understanding. The exploration extends to detailed insights into passenger traffic, encompassing terminal dynamics, boarding gate allocations, and the influence of pricing on travel decisions, all vividly presented through visual aids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delving deeper, the blog sheds light on the disparity between domestic and international terminals, unveiling SFO's position in passenger preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The apex of the blog lies in impactful data visualizations, including a detailed passenger traffic study, considerations of price in travel decisions, and the identification of SFO's busiest day for departing airlines. Extended analysis covers aircraft specifics, revealing patterns in overflight route management, assessing airline presence over time, and determining whether SFO leans more towards being an \"arrival\" or \"departures\" center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives for this analysis were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Terminal Analysis:** Conduct a thorough study of passenger traffic at each terminal and boarding area in SFO.\n",
    "- **Passenger Preference:** Explore the significance of price in passengers' travel decisions.\n",
    "- **Busiest Day Identification:** Identify and analyze the busiest day for airlines departing from SFO.\n",
    "- **Aircraft Diversity:** Analyze the types of aircraft used by each airline at SFO.\n",
    "- **Long-Term Trends:** Examine passenger counts over time to gauge airline sustainability.\n",
    "- **Arrival vs. Departures:** Investigate whether SFO is more of an \"arrival\" or \"departures\" center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Offer stakeholders actionable insights for strategic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Collection and Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in the analysis was obtained from 2 sources, each providing distinct perspectives on San Francisco International Airport's (SFO) air traffic.\n",
